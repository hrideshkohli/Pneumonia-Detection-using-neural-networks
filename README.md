# Pneumonia-Detection-using-neural-networks

The dataset contains lots of images of the X-RAY scans of the chest of many different people with and without Pneumonia. 

A model based on convolution neural network was created to accurately predict pneumonia presence based on the scanned chest XRAY image.
